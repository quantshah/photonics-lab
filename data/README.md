# Data files

- 2_OSA_Spectrum_Comb.csv: Optical comb data recorded by OSA ('GPIB3::22::INSTR') with center wavelength 1549.5 nm and spacing of 15.

- 3_displacement_{-1, 0, 1, 2}: Optical power after added dispersion in linear scale measured by OSO.

- 4_phase_noise_{1, 2, ref}km.csv: Phase noise measured in dB for 1km and 2km fibers, and reference point with OSA.

- phase-sensitive-amp-phase-{x}.mat: The phase sensitive amplication measured for wavelengths [1548, 1549, 1550] nm with attenuation [0, 20, 0] in dB using OSA. The resolution was 0.05 for the OSA with 5000 sampling points. The center wavelength was set to 1548.5 nm
